      <p>
        {APP} is operated by {ORG} through {SCHOOL} ("we", "us", "the Institute"). This policy
        explains what personal data we collect from students, faculty and staff who use {APP}, how
        we use it, and the rights you have under India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
        (the "DPDP Act").
      </p>

      <h2>Data we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account &amp; profile:</strong> name, email, role and profile details, managed through our authentication provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Coursework:</strong> assignments, submissions (text, files, links, recordings), quiz responses, grades, rubric marks and feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Participation:</strong> attendance, discussion posts, notes, journal entries, course feedback and messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> log and activity data (e.g. sign-ins, actions) and privacy-friendly, aggregate analytics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use it</h2>
      <p>To provide the platform: enrolment, teaching, assessment and AI-assisted grading, feedback,
        oversight and analytics for the Institute, notifications, security and improving the service.
        Our legal basis is the delivery of educational services to you and our legitimate educational
        interests, consistent with the DPDP Act.</p>

      <h2>AI-assisted grading</h2>
      <p>Text submissions may be processed by an AI model to draft a suggested grade and feedback,
        which a human educator reviews before finalising. We use an India-based provider so that this
        processing stays within the country where feasible. AI never issues a final grade on its own.</p>

      <h2>Service providers</h2>
      <p>We share data only with processors that help us run {APP}, under contract and only as needed:
        authentication, database hosting, file storage, email/notifications, AI grading, and hosting/
        analytics. We do not sell your personal data.</p>

      <h2>Where your data is stored</h2>
      <p>We aim to host student data in India. Some providers may process limited data in other
        regions; where that happens we take steps consistent with the DPDP Act. [Confirm the exact
        regions of your database, storage and hosting and list them here.]</p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>We keep personal data for as long as you have an account and as required for academic records
        and legal obligations, after which it is deleted or anonymised. [Set your retention periods.]</p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>Under the DPDP Act you may request access to, correction of, or erasure of your personal data,
        and may withdraw consent where processing relies on it. To exercise these rights or raise a
        grievance, contact our Grievance Officer at {CONTACT}. [Name your Grievance Officer.]</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard measures (encryption in transit, access controls, redaction of secrets
        in logs). No system is perfectly secure; please keep your credentials safe.</p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>We use only essential cookies needed to sign you in and keep you logged in. See our{" "}
        <Link href="/legal/cookies">Cookie Notice</Link> for details.</p>

      <h2>Children &amp; students</h2>
      <p>{APP} is used by enrolled students and staff. Where a user is a minor, processing is carried out
        in the context of the Institute's educational relationship; [add any parental-consent process
        your institution requires].</p>

      <h2>Changes &amp; contact</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy and will post the new date above. Questions: {CONTACT}.</p>
